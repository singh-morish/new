why react?
react is composable, large UI can be divided in smaller part and reassembled to create complete UI, help us to create single page applications

single page application - web application which loads a single HTML and update the part of the documents using javascript

multipage applications - traditional implementation of web application which reload whole page when the user interacts with the application

react is a decelarative language we tell the react what to do not how to do 


DOM(Document Object Model)
Documenet stands for HTML filec and object stands for Node

virtual DOM - programming concept where an ideal or "virtual" representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM
if we are making changes to any node of the DOM then first changes will be reflected in the virtual DOM 


const reactHeading = React.createElement("h1", {className: "head", id :"reactHead", children:"hello React"})


ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root).render(reactHeading))


JSX(Javascript XML) - javascript + HTML
JSX is a extension to the HTML


react with JSX - 
const jsxHeading = (<h1>Hello JSX</h1>)
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(jsxHeading)
